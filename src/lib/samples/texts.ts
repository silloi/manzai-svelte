Com: Where do you come from, Socrates?

Com: And yet I need hardly ask the question, for I know that you have been in chase of the fair Alcibiades.

Com: I saw the day before yesterday; and he had got a beard like a man-and he is a man, as I may tell you in your ear.

Com: But I thought that he was still very charming.

Soc: What of his beard?

Soc: Are you not of Homer's opinion, who says

Soc: Youth is most charming when the beard first appears?

Soc: And that is now the charm of Alcibiades.

Com: Well, and how do matters proceed?

Com: Have you been visiting him, and was he gracious to you?

Soc: Yes, I thought that he was very gracious; and especially to-day, for I have just come from him, and he has been helping me in an argument.

Soc: But shall I tell you a strange thing?

Soc: I paid no attention to him, and several times I quite forgot that he was present.

Com: What is the meaning of this?

Com: Has anything happened between you and him?

Com: For surely you cannot have discovered a fairer love than he is; certainly not in this city of Athens.

Soc: Yes, much fairer.

Com: What do you mean-a citizen or a foreigner?

Soc: A foreigner.

Com: Of what country?

Soc: Of Abdera.

Com: And is this stranger really in your opinion a fairer love than the son of Cleinias?

Soc: And is not the wiser always the fairer, sweet friend?

Com: But have you really met, Socrates, with some wise one?

Soc: Say rather, with the wisest of all living men, if you are willing to accord that title to Protagoras.

Com: What! Is Protagoras in Athens?

Soc: Yes; he has been here two days.

Com: And do you just come from an interview with him?

Soc: Yes; and I have heard and said many things.

Com: Then, if you have no engagement, suppose that you sit down tell me what passed, and my attendant here shall give up his place to you.

Soc: To be sure; and I shall be grateful to you for listening.

Com: Thank you, too, for telling us.

Soc: That is thank you twice over.

Soc: Listen then:
